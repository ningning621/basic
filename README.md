# Basic

First attempt at creating an Android application, in collaboration with Trishla Pokharna

The application features an internal database, object oriented programming, and intents. 

The app acts like a real diary where the user can only update the entry of the current day. If the user chooses to delete old entries, those entries will be unretrieveable to mimick tearing a page out of a physical journal.
